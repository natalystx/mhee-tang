## 1. Business Model & Feature Tiers

### Business Model: Freemium

The app operates on a **Freemium** model designed for the Thai market. The goal is to attract a wide user base with a functional free tier and provide a clear, compelling upgrade path through four distinct tiers as users' financial needs mature.

- **Free Tier:** An entry point for basic expense tracking, offering a limited taste of the app's core automation.
- **Premium Tier:** The core paid offering, providing a complete, automated, real-time view of a user's entire financial health _right now_.
- **Planner Tier:** A mid-tier plan for users ready to actively plan their financial future with powerful forecasting and debt-planning tools, without AI-driven features.
- **Planner Plus Tier:** The high-end tier for power users, focused on optimizing their future with unlimited forecasting and AI-powered guidance.
